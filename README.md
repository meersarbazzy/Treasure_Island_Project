# Treasure_Island_Project
**Treasure Island** is a Python text-based adventure game. Players make decisions using inputs to find treasure. The game uses `if-else` statements for decision-making, string operations for input handling, and basic I/O for interaction. Each choice leads to unique outcomes, making it engaging and replayable. Find the treasure or face challenges!
